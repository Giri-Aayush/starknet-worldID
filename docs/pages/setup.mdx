# Complete Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and deploy the Starknet World ID Bridge. Follow these steps to integrate World ID verification capabilities into your Starknet applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have all the required tools installed. See our [Prerequisites Guide](/prerequisites) for detailed installation instructions.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet-worldcoin-bridge.git
```

## Set Up Your Bridge

### 1. Deploy the L1 Contract

Deploy the L1 contract using the Address of the World ID Manager, a temporary L2 address (ie. 1), and the address of the Starknet Sequencer - Core Contract:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here" src/StarkStateBridge.sol:StarkStateBridge --constructor-args 0xb2ead588f14e69266d1b87936b75325181377076 1 0xE2Bb56ee936fd6433DC0F6e7e3b8365C906AA057
```

### 2. Deploy the L2 Contract

Take the L1 contract deployed address and use it to deploy the L2 contract along with the fixed tree depth of 30:

```bash
starkli deploy --account "your_account_here" 0x014ebe12cfbf193a8c929213e6ad40cf3111ba1c931c3b3ac0de57ffa903186f --keystore "your_keystore_here" "your_L1_contract_address(from step 1)" 30
```

### 3. Configure the Bridge

Take the L2 address and change the L1 contract's L2 address by invoking the "setStarkWorldIDAddress(uint256)" function with the L2 address:

```bash
cast send "your_L1_contract_address(from step 1)" --from "your_L1_wallet_address" --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here" "setStarkWorldIDAddress(uint256)" "Your_L2_contract_address_(from step 2)"
```

### 4. Activate the Bridge

The bridge is now set up. You can propagate the root by sending ETH as the value parameter:

```bash
cast send "your_L1_contract_address(from step 1)" --from "your_L1_wallet_address" --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here" "propagateRoot()"
```

**Note:** You will need to supply your L1 account/wallet to use the bridge.

## Testing Your Setup

For local testing, you can use the provided scripts to set up a development environment:

```bash
cd starknet-worldcoin-bridge/state_bridge_l1
cp anvil.env .env
source .env
forge script script/SetupContracts.s.sol:LocalSetup --broadcast --rpc-url ${ETH_RPC_URL}
```

In a new terminal, run the test script that launches the relay:

```bash
cd starknet-worldcoin-bridge/monodock/state_bridge_service
cargo test
```

## Verification

To verify your setup is working correctly, see our [Verification Guide](/verification).

## Testnet Deployment

For testnet deployment, you can reference these addresses:

- L1 address: [0xb6455FCb8e092aB70C7195709AbF3832ff9a6F34](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xb6455FCb8e092aB70C7195709AbF3832ff9a6F34)
- L2 address: [0x05d5fbb9d968eb019d9066dd5a92d589fc56f0f45b9301afd3a29b3b79476dd3](https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/0x05d5fbb9d968eb019d9066dd5a92d589fc56f0f45b9301afd3a29b3b79476dd3#transactions)

## Next Steps

After successfully setting up the Starknet World ID Bridge, you can:

1. Integrate it with your Starknet applications
2. Implement Sybil-resistant verification in your smart contracts
3. Learn more about World ID verification patterns
4. Contribute to the bridge development
