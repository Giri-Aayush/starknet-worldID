# Verification Guide

This guide helps you verify that your Starknet World ID Bridge setup is working correctly.

## Prerequisites Verification

After installing all prerequisites, verify your setup by running:

```bash
# Check Rust
rustc --version

# Check Foundry
forge --version

# Check Starkli
starkli --version
```

All commands should return version information without errors.

## Bridge Deployment Verification

### 1. Verify L1 Contract Deployment

Check that your L1 contract was deployed successfully:

```bash
cast code "your_L1_contract_address" --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here"
```

This should return the contract bytecode (not `0x`).

### 2. Verify L2 Contract Deployment

Check your L2 contract deployment on Starknet:

```bash
starkli class-hash-at "your_L2_contract_address"
```

This should return the class hash of your deployed contract.

### 3. Verify Bridge Configuration

Check that the L1 contract has the correct L2 address configured:

```bash
cast call "your_L1_contract_address" --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here" "starkWorldIDAddress()(uint256)"
```

This should return your L2 contract address.

## Functional Verification

### Test Root Propagation

Try propagating a root to test the bridge functionality:

```bash
cast send "your_L1_contract_address" --from "your_L1_wallet_address" --rpc-url "your_eth_rpc_here" "propagateRoot()" --value 0.01ether
```

Monitor the transaction to ensure it completes successfully.

### Check Bridge Status

Verify the bridge is active and processing messages correctly by checking recent transactions on both L1 and L2 contracts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Prerequisites not found:**
- Ensure your PATH is properly configured
- Restart your terminal after installation
- Check that installation completed without errors

**Contract deployment fails:**
- Verify you have sufficient funds for gas fees
- Check that your RPC URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure you're using the correct network (mainnet vs testnet)

**Bridge configuration issues:**
- Double-check all contract addresses
- Verify transaction confirmations before proceeding
- Ensure you're using the correct wallet addresses
