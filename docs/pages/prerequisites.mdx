# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for Ethereum contract development
- [Starkli](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli) for Starknet contract deployment
- Basic familiarity with Ethereum and Starknet development

## Rust

Rust is a general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.

### MacOS and Linux

Rust is installed and managed using the `rustup` tool. For more information, see the `rustup` documentation.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Using rustup to install Rust:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade --profile minimal --component clippy
```

### Windows

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set up Rust on Windows.

## Foundry

Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain that helps you manage dependencies, compile projects, run tests, deploy contracts, and interact with the blockchain via the command line and Solidity scripts.

### MacOS and Linux

To install `foundryup`, open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

To install the nightly version, run:

```bash
foundryup
```

### Windows

**Note:** If you're using Windows, you need to install and use Git Bash or WSL as your terminal. foundryup currently doesn't support PowerShell or Command Prompt. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for more details.

## Starkli

Starkli allows you to query Starknet and make transactions with ease. It's fast, easy to install, and intuitive to use.

### MacOS and Linux

Install Starkli on MacOS and Linux using the `starkliup` portable script.

Download `starkliup`:

```bash
curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
```

Restart the terminal and install Starkli:

```bash
starkliup
```

Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installed correctly:

```bash
starkli --version
```

### Windows

Starkli installation on Windows requires manually setting up shell completions.

Install Starkli:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli
```

Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installed correctly:

```bash
starkli --version
```

Set up Starkli's shell completions by following the instructions in the [Starkli documentation](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli).

## Verification

To verify all prerequisites are properly installed, see our [Verification Guide](/verification).
